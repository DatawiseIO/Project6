# Statistics & Monitoring

Statistics & monitoring is enabled by default in Project6. Container metrics
are collected periodically in a centralized time series database. The metrics
can be viewed in grafana dashboard at the virtual-ip url: http://&lt;virtual-ip&gt;:8000

This is a work in progress. Expect more improvements to the grafana dashboard
soon.
